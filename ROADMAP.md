# ZenithSoC Roadmap

The project will be developed using an incremental approach, structured into four distinct phases. Each phase builds upon the functionality established in the preceding step, progressively enhancing the platform capabilities. Notably, these phases are designed to be modular, allowing for any configuration to operate independently without dependency on subsequent additions. Here’s the phased development plan:

## Basic Configuration Features

* CPU 100MHz
* Interrupt Controller
* On Chip Memory
* Boot ROM
* GPIO
* Timers
* UART
* Single Master AXI Interconnection Network

## Microcontroller Configuration Features

* CPU 100MHz
* Interrupt Controller
* On Chip Memory
* Boot ROM
* GPIO
* Timers
* UART
* SPI
* I²C
* I²S
* Ethernet
* PRNG
* Single Master AXI Interconnection Network

## Microprocessor Configuration Features
