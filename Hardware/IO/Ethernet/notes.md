CRS_DV is asserted asynchronously on detection of carrier due to the criteria relevant to the operating mode: NEEDS TO BE SYNCHRONIZED PROPERLY (2 FF SYNC) AS WELL AS RXD AND RXERR SIGNALS

The period is 20 ns with the 50 MHz REF_CLK and remains at this frequency regardless of whether the PHY is set to 10Mbps or 100Mbps mode: IN 100Mbps THE TX SHALL CHANGE THE DATA EVERY CLOCK CYCLE, IN 10Mbps EVERY 10 CYCLES. SAME GOES FOR RX.
